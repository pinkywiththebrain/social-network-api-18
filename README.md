  ## Description
  In this project I was instructed to create the backend for a social network app using MongoDB. This app would allow users to make posts, add comments to those posts, as well as add other users to their friends list. Additionally the user would be able to edit and delete posts and comments, as while as delete friends. This assignment helped me understand how to create routes and databases using MongoDB.
  
  ## Installation Instructions
  Run ```npm i``` in the terminal and then ```npm start``` to start the server. From there you can test each route in Insomnia.
